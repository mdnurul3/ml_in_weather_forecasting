This forlder contains code:
Machine Learning techniques can help to accurately predict
temperatures based on a set of input features, which can include the previous values of temperature,
relative humidity, solar radiation, rain and wind speed measurements, among others.

Currently applying two popular Techniques:
#Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks:
LSTM with 50 neurons in the first hidden layer and 1 neuron in the output.
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function and the efficient Adam version of stochastic gradient descent.
The model will be fit for 50 training epochs with a batch size of 72.


#Support Vector Machine(SVM) 

We found that Deep Learning strategies report smaller errors (Mean Square Error = 0.0017 K) compared
with traditional Artificial Neural Networks architectures, for 1 step-ahead at regional scale. At the
global scale, Support Vector Machines are preferred based on their good compromise between
simplicity and accuracy.

The data used in this particular analysis from Cambridge Computer Laboratory Rooftop Weather from 6/30/1995  3:30:00 PM To 11/12/2020 2:00 AM.
